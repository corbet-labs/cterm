//! Dedicated PTY writer thread.
//!
//! All writes to a session's PTY master — keyboard input and parser-generated
//! responses (DSR/DA/cursor reports, etc.) — are routed through a single
//! [`PtyWriter`]. The actual `write_all` happens on a dedicated OS thread that is
//! *expected* to block: if the child stops draining its stdin and the PTY buffer
//! fills, that thread blocks instead of a tokio worker thread holding the terminal
//! lock. This prevents a wedged child from starving the gRPC runtime (the cause of
//! the daemon deadlock).
//!
//! A single FIFO channel preserves the relative ordering of input and responses.
//! The channel is bounded; if it fills (child wedged), further writes are dropped
//! and logged rather than blocking the enqueuer — bounding memory and never stalling
//! a worker thread. A terminal whose child has stopped reading is already
//! non-functional, so dropping further bytes is the correct degradation.
