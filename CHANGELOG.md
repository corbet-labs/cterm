# Changelog

All notable changes to cterm are documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and the project loosely follows semantic versioning. The whole workspace shares
a single version via `[workspace.package]`. Pure CI, lint, and formatting churn
is omitted for readability.

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- A fail-closed command-plugin foundation with fixed WebAssembly packages,
  strict manifests, content-addressed trust, exact per-action grants, and a
  bounded versioned protobuf ABI, plus a separate one-shot Wasmi/WASIp1 runner
  with digest revalidation, fuel, memory, stack, table, input, and output
  limits. The application-side broker adds canonical package-relative host and
  plugin resolution, deterministic command discovery, atomic machine-local
  grant persistence, stale-descriptor rejection, exact pre/post-execution
  grant enforcement, typed native-action conversion, bounded framed process
  I/O, a strict wall timeout, and Unix process-group / Windows Job Object
  termination. Release packages include the runner; native grant prompts and
  UI command integration remain a subsequent stage.
- Native FreeBSD builds now compile the GTK4/Wayland client and daemon and run
  their portable library and daemon-integration tests in a FreeBSD 14.4 VM.
- Foot-compatible independent cursor blink sources and native cursor/text
  blink rendering across GTK/Wayland, Cocoa, and Win32, including distinct
  slow and rapid SGR phases and daemon snapshot persistence.

### Fixed
- Streamed OSC 1337 interception now replays incomplete, cancelled, and
  oversized sequences atomically instead of leaving the VTE parser inside a
  partial control string. Large replay and decoded-transfer spill files are
  unique and private, and failed receptions remove their temporary storage.

### Security
- Plugin package files are size-checked before allocation, read through a
  strict `limit + 1` bound, and rejected if their length changes during the
  read.
- Added a hard RustSec advisory gate, upgraded `anyhow`, `bytes`, `h2`, and
  `tar` to patched compatible releases, and removed the unused, unmaintained
  `bincode` dependency.

## [0.0.20] - 2026-08-31

### Added
- Direct command launch with exact argv, working directory, environment, title,
  and initial native window state, plus an isolated managed-product mode with
  authenticated local daemon handshakes and exact identity/version matching.
- Cross-platform inline Sixel and iTerm2 image rendering and persistence, plus
  font-independent box, block, Braille, and legacy-computing glyph rendering.
- Foot-compatible terminal behavior including palette stacks and dynamic
  colors, native theme/visibility reports, DEC rectangular editing,
  synchronized updates, reverse wrap/video, DEC special graphics, keypad
  identity, modified and Kitty keys, capability/status queries, pixel and
  URXVT mouse reporting, OSC 7 working-directory tracking, and colon-form SGR
  colors.
- OSC 133 shell integration with prompt navigation and native OSC 9/777 and
  Kitty OSC 99 desktop notifications on macOS, Wayland, and Windows.
- Foot-compatible Sixel cursor placement, aspect ratios, private/shared
  palettes, resource limits, geometry/color replies, and up to 1024 colors.
- Native split panes on AppKit, GTK4/Wayland, and Win32/Direct2D, including
  draggable dividers, directional focus and resize, pane zoom, and configurable
  shortcuts. New panes inherit the active pane's exact process or SSH launch
  context and its working directory where the target daemon can honor one;
  native SSH keeps the same target while the remote login shell selects its
  initial directory.
- Deterministic parser/render/reflow/scrollback benchmarks, real-TUI and foot
  differential compatibility tests, authoritative native UI automation, and
  FreeBSD core CI.

### Changed
- Establish FSL-1.1-ALv2 as cterm's product license, with Apache-2.0 becoming
  available automatically after two years per version. Source inherited from
  KarpelesLab/cterm and Rio/Sugarloaf retains its MIT grants and notices.
- Store complete extended grapheme clusters and safely reflow scrollback when
  the terminal resizes.
- Seamless-upgrade state now preserves every window, tab, complete split
  topology, pane session, and exact process/SSH launch context.
- Linux and Windows client packages now bundle the matching `ctermd`; every
  distributed client and daemon package carries the product and inherited-code
  license notices and a SHA-256 checksum sidecar.

### Fixed
- Render scrollback and terminal attributes consistently across Direct2D,
  CoreGraphics, and GTK/Cairo.
- Windows child processes now keep their standard streams attached to ConPTY,
  including when ctermd itself runs with redirected handles.
- Unix PTYs now use the platform login-terminal setup, removing intermittent
  controlling-terminal failures on FreeBSD.
- OSC 10/11/12 color queries now receive theme-accurate replies from the
  attached frontend. Dynamic foreground, background, and cursor colors support
  foot-compatible XParseColor forms, reset through OSC 110/111/112, render on
  every desktop backend, and survive daemon reconnection.
- Restoring pane snapshots no longer leaks daemon attachment counts, and
  independent windows connected to the same SSH host no longer overwrite or
  tear down each other's tunnel registry entries.
- GTK tab context menus activate reliably, and SSH dialogs remember and
  autocomplete earlier targets.
- Update checks and remote daemon bootstrapping use the `corbet-labs` release
  source. Client assets and checksums are matched by exact platform filenames,
  Linux archives are validated before relaunch, and daemon-only assets can no
  longer be mistaken for client updates.
- Cocoa split-pane layout releases mutable model borrows before re-entry, and
  obtains its CoreGraphics drawing context through the typed AppKit binding.

## [0.0.19] - 2026-07-09

### Added
- Mouse-event forwarding parity on macOS: right/middle-button reports, drag
  motion, and alternate-scroll (DECSET 1007) so pagers (less/man/vim) scroll via
  the wheel even without mouse tracking. Holding Shift bypasses reporting so
  selection, scrollback, and context menus keep working under a tracking app.

### Fixed
- SSH-tunneled sessions no longer drop at the ~1h mark: the mid-session rekey
  fault (OpenSSH's default rekey interval), which surfaced as an opaque h2
  "error reading a body from connection" cascade, is fixed by puressh 0.1.3.
- The SSH tunnel's serve loop now logs its termination cause at `warn` (rekey
  fault, keepalive timeout, decrypt/MAC error, peer EOF) instead of `debug`, so
  the real reason for a mid-session disconnect is visible.

## [0.0.18] - 2026-07-07

### Added
- Native SSH via puressh, replacing the system `ssh` binary; the self-updater
  now uses rsurl instead of reqwest (MSRV 1.88).
- Interactive SSH auth for the remote tunnel: keyboard-interactive, plus native
  host-key / password / passphrase prompt dialogs on macOS, GTK, and Windows.
- Run gRPC directly over the SSH channel — no locally forwarded socket file.
- Jump-host chains via a `>` separator (`bastion:2222>10.0.0.5`), plus SSH
  connection history in the connect dialog.
- Default `~/.ssh/id_*` identity files are loaded automatically (including
  PKCS#1/SEC1/PKCS#8 and `id_xmss`); identities are offered lazily via their
  `.pub` and only decrypted on demand.
- zlib compression (`zlib@openssh.com`) on the gRPC daemon tunnel, cutting the
  transfer for screen snapshots and scrollback.
- Mouse-event forwarding and alternate-scroll in the GTK and Windows terminals.

### Fixed
- Reconnecting a window with many tabs no longer stalls: sessions attach
  concurrently, RPCs no longer serialize on the connection mutex, and each tab
  fetches its screen snapshot only once (no redundant scrollback transfer or
  placeholder resize).
- Detect a stale `ctermd` socket by connecting rather than trusting the PID
  file, and prevent a daemon deadlock from hanging cterm startup.
- Cross-platform SSH build fixes (gate ssh-agent to Unix; Windows
  `EM_SETPASSWORDCHAR` cast).

## [0.0.17] - 2026-06-22

### Added
- Hyperlink (OSC 8) rendering, hover, and interaction across GTK, macOS, and Windows.
- Streaming input RPC with batched fallback for low-latency typing.
- Custom SSH port in remote dialogs (`user@host:port`).
- Scrollbar overlay for the terminal view (macOS + GTK).
- Bell/alert state managed through the `ctermd` daemon; alerted tabs are visually distinct.
- Serialize DRCS soft fonts and charset state across gRPC reconnection.
- Confirm close when a foreground process is running in daemon sessions; auto-close tabs when the shell exits.
- New tabs inherit daemon context from the current tab (macOS); SSH Remote attaches to all existing sessions.
- Disconnect action in the remote tab right-click menu.
- Raise the gRPC message size limit to 64 MB for large scrollback snapshots.
- Enable SSH compression (`-C`) on remote tunnels by default.

### Fixed
- Keep word/line selection stable across scrollback wrap.
- Connect to the correct daemon for remote SSH sessions; keep the SSH tunnel alive across tokio runtimes.
- GTK4 tab bar styling, close button, auto-close on shell exit, and Ctrl+PageUp/PageDown navigation.
- Persist custom tab title to the daemon from the Set Title menu action.
- Double-borrow panic when closing a tab via the close button.

### Removed
- Experimental mosh, Latch, relay, and "unixshells" integrations (prototyped during this cycle, then removed before release).

## [0.0.16] - 2026-03-15

Daemon-centric architecture: all sessions now run through `ctermd`.

### Added
- Route all terminal sessions through the `ctermd` daemon, with attach/detach semantics so sessions survive UI restarts and seamless upgrades.
- New `cterm-client` library and `cterm-proto` crate for daemon communication over gRPC.
- Daemon session reconnection, lifecycle management, and graceful SIGTERM shutdown.
- Remote host management with automatic `ctermd` install; SSH remote support over stdio/socket forwarding.
- Incremental screen updates in `StreamScreenUpdates`.
- Persist tab metadata (color, title, template) in the daemon.
- macOS daemon-backed terminal view and session menu; GTK daemon-backed terminal widget.
- "Kill Local ctermd" and relaunch-in-place debug menu items across all frontends.

### Changed
- Simplified the upgrade protocol; removed standalone crash recovery in favor of daemon-backed sessions.

### Fixed
- Preserve screen state, custom tab titles, colors, template, window frame, and active tab across daemon relaunch/upgrade.
- Smarter daemon auto-shutdown by tracking active streams; destroy sessions on tab close.
- Raise the file descriptor limit at startup; restore it for child processes.

### Added
- macOS: render bold, italic, and dim (SGR 2) text; `bold_is_bright` option.
- GTK4: input method (IM) support for Japanese/CJK input, Ctrl+PageUp/PageDown tab switching, and libadwaita menu styling with visible keyboard shortcuts.
- Include dots in word selection (e.g. version strings).

### Fixed
- Word selection across wrapped line boundaries.
- GTK4: reset scroll to bottom on input, scrollback rendering on mouse scroll, Ctrl+Shift shortcuts, menu display, and window title on tab switch.
- Close the PTY master FD on tab close (FD leak); set `FD_CLOEXEC` on PTY master and watchdog socket FDs.
- Capture the executable path at startup for reliable relaunch.

## [0.0.14] - 2026-02-21

### Added
- Auto-scroll when dragging a selection beyond the terminal bounds.
